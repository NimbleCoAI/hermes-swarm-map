# Runbook: git-sourced artifacts (the trust gate in practice)

How a plugin / skill / hook goes from a private repo to a live agent, safely.
Companion to `../specs/2026-06-03-artifact-commons-design.md` and
`../architecture/image-vs-hsm-boundary.md`.

## 1. Build the artifact in its own (private) repo
- **One repo per artifact** (or one for a tightly-paired plugin+skill). Start **private**.
- Layout (osint-engine convention): `hermes-plugin/` (`plugin.yaml` + `__init__.py`
  + code), `hermes-skill/SKILL.md`, `tests/`.
- `plugin.yaml` declares `declared_capabilities` (e.g. `tools: []`, `network: true`).
- Add GitHub collaborators to the private repo to collaborate **before** it's public.

## 2. Tag it — pinning is mandatory
```sh
git tag v0.1.0 && git push origin v0.1.0
```
The manifest references a **tag**, never a branch. `parseGitSource` rejects an
unpinned source loudly (an unpinned ref can silently drift to malicious code).

## 3. Reference it in the manifest
`infra/artifacts.json`:
```json
{ "name": "captcha_solver", "source": "git:<org>/<repo>#v0.1.0", "enabled": true }
```

## 4. Provision the build-time token (HSM server env)
- `ARTIFACT_GIT_TOKEN` (falls back to `GITHUB_TOKEN`) on the **HSM server** —
  deliberately distinct from the per-agent runtime `GITHUB_TOKEN`; the agent never
  sees it.
- It MUST be a token with **`contents:read`** on the artifact repos: a **classic
  PAT with `repo`**, or a **fine-grained PAT** scoped to the artifact repos.
  > A `gh`-CLI `ghu_` OAuth/App token may **not** have repo-contents access — a
  > clone returns `remote: Write access to repository not granted.` Use a PAT.
- The token is delivered to git via `GIT_ASKPASS` + an `x-access-token` username —
  **never** in the clone URL or argv (see Security notes).

## 5. What HSM does on agent create
`installBaselineTemplates` → `installArtifacts`:
```
parse (pin-enforced) → shallow clone at the tag → content trust gate
(injection / promptware scan) → REFUSE on a finding, else install
```
The image-side enforcement (per-plugin `declared_capabilities` dispatch gate +
fail-closed plugin-skill scan) is the **runtime backstop** — defense in depth.

## 6. Going public
Flip the artifact repo's visibility **private → public**. Nothing else changes —
the `git:<org>/<repo>#<tag>` reference is identical, history is preserved.

## Security notes
- **Never put the token in the clone URL or argv.** It leaks via `ps` and via
  clone error messages. Use `GIT_ASKPASS` (token in the child env, not on disk in
  plaintext) + the `x-access-token` username. Errors are redacted (`redactSecrets`)
  as defense in depth. (Learned the hard way: an early version embedded the token
  in the URL and a failed clone printed it — rotate any token exposed this way.)
- **Keep the HSM-side TS threat-pattern scanner in sync** with the image-side
  Python library (`tools/threat_patterns.py`) when patterns change.
- A git-sourced artifact crossing into the commons is the cross-trust-boundary
  case: this is where `declared_capabilities` should become **mandatory** (vs
  opt-in for trusted local plugins).
